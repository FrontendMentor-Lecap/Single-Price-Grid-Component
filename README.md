## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about positioning strategies to prevent using media queries as much as possible. It can be sometimes difficult to create a product that can scale with the shortest amount of code. I learned about coloring with variables and different shortcuts VSCODE gives you to select colors faster.  

Initially I thought that the "Why Us" division had a paragraph inside, but then I saw it was an unordered list with 7 li's.

I also learned about different techniques to create shades, and I hope I used the appopriate ones for the main component and the "Sign Up" link.


### Continued development

I still want to continue improving with Rem's and EM's , specially while assigning margin and padding values. I also want to continue improving my coding speed, I think I take a long time to do a simple thing. Knowledge and experience are big part of the latter.
